v1.3.048 (23 Jan 2019)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

MAJOR NEW FEATURES
- Tartube now creates an icon in the user's system tray. Closing the main
    window now closes to the tray, by default. To disable this behaviour,
    click Edit > System preferences > Windows > Deselect 'Close to the tray...'
- When that functionality is enabled, Tartube can be shutdown by clicking
    File > Quit. Scheduled download operations will still take place if Tartube
    has been closed to the tray. Implements Github issue #37
- Tartube can now show a desktop notification at the end of a download
    operation, rather that a dialogue window. This does not work on MS Windows.
    On other operating systems, enable desktop notifications by clicking
    Edit > System preferences... > Operations > Show a desktop notification...
- When you click the 'Add new video(s)' button, the folder displayed in the
    dialogue window is now the same folder that's selected in the main window
    (if any). The same applies for adding channels, playlists and folders.
    Fixes Github issue #36
- If you normally use the 'Check all' button rather than the 'Download all'
    button, and if you want to download a temporary copy of one of the videos,
    there's now an easier way to do it. In the Videos tab, right-click the
    video, and select 'Temporary > Download' or 'Temporary > Download and
    Watch'. A copy of the video is downloaded into the 'Temporary Videos'
    folder, without affecting any other folders

MINOR NEW FEATURES
- The icons for channels and playlists have been replaced, to make it easier to
    tell them apart. Some other icons have been replaced too
- Videos can now be dragged and dropped from a web browser (or similar
    application) into Tartube's main window, which automatically adds the video
    to the currently selected folder (or 'Unsorted Videos', if no folder is
    selected). Unfortunately, the code is not yet working reliably. We are
    looking for a solution (Github issue #35)
- The layout of the Format tab in the download options window has been improved
    to alleviate confusion experienced by users trying to download a video to
    a sound format such as .mp3 (only). See the new section in the README file
- A number of new video/audio formats have been added, for example several new
    60fps formats, implementing Github issue #40
- When you apply download options to a video/channel/playlist/folder, the
    options are now cloned from the default set of options (those visible in
    Edit > General download options...). To disable this behaviour, click
    Edit > System preferences... > Operations > When applying download options,
    automatically clone general download options. Implements Github issue #39
- The options already applied to a video/channel/playlist/folder can now be
    reset to match the general options, any time you want. Use the new button
    at the bottom of the download options window, in the General tab

MAJOR FIXES
- Fixed a rare crash when the video's JSON filename was too long for the
    operating system
- In the download options window, Formats tab, the user can add up to three
    video formats. The third format, if added, was always ignored. Fixed

MINOR FIXES
- If you perform a refresh operation on a folder, the operation now applies to
    all videos, channels, playlists and folders inside it
- After adding a video to the folder that's currently selected, the video does
    not appear immediately in the video catalogue. Fixed
- In the Progress and Errors/Warnings tabs, the column headers scrolled away
    along with the rest of the list. Fixed; they are now always visible
- Video nicknames were not set correctly after an update operation. Fixed
- During a refresh operation, a video's name was compared against the full
    filepath (filename and extension), which produced none of the intended
    matches. Fixed
- The edit/preference windows had a tendency to increase in size without
    limits. Fixed
- A video's annotations.xml file was not deleted correctly, when required.
    Fixed
- In the download options window, the option 'hls-prefer-ffmpeg' is now working
    correctly
- In the download options window, the 'prefer avconv over ffmpeg' options have
    been desensitised on MS Windows, as there is no known method of using
    Tartube with avconv on MS Windows
- youtube-dl creates a file, ytdl-archive.txt, recording all the videos that
    it has downloaded. This can interfere if the user tries to re-download the
    video(s) for any reason. Create of the ytdl-archive.txt file can now be
    disabled (Edit > System preferences... > youtube-dl > Deselect 'Allow
    youtube-dl to create its own archive...')
- If creation of the archive file is nonetheless enabled, Tartube can now
    re-download video(s) without problems
- In rare circumstances, Tartube was unable to redraw the video catalogue
    (the right-hand side of the Videos tab). Fxied

v1.3.007 (20 Dec 2019)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

MAJOR FIXES
- v1.3.007 was completely broken when replacing an earlier installation. Fixed
- When Tartube's data directory was copied from one place to another (for
    example, from one external drive to another), Tartube did not adapt to the
    change very well. The way file paths are stored in Tartube's database has
    been changed to eliminate this problem

MINOR FIXES
- Fixed an invalid time value which (sometimes) prevented a refresh operation
    from completing correctly

v1.3.0 (20 Dec 2019)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MAJOR NEW FEATURES
- Tartube on MS Windows did not recognise FFmpeg or AVConv. You can now tell
    Tartube to download and install a compatible version of FFmpeg from the
    main menu (Operations > Install FFmpeg). Tartube still cannot recognise
    the ordinary version of FFmpeg, and it still does not recognise AVConv at
    all. It is unlikely that this situation can be remedied
- A new Output Tab has been added, in which you can see what is happening
    internally when you check or download videos, update youtube-dl, install
    FFmpeg, or refresh the Tartube database. The amount of information shown
    can be customised in the System preferences window. The information can
    still be written to STDOUT/STDERR, if required
- For users on other operating systems, the system preferences window
    displayed the wrong location of the FFmpeg/AVConv executable. This has now
    been fixed
- There are now two simple ways to specify the video resolution you want to
    download (for example, 1080p). You can use the download options window
    (Edit > General download options... > Formats, and then choose a video
    format like 'any format [1080p]'). You can also use the new spinbutton at
    the bottom of the Progress Tab. Both of these methods have the same effect,
    so it's not necessary to use both of them. Tartube will download videos in
    that resolution if possible, or in the next highest available resolution
    otherwise
- The download options window has been simplified, with only the most useful
    options visible. If you want to see the full range of options, open any
    download options window, and in the General tab, click the new 'Show
    advanced download options' button

MINOR NEW FEATURES
- By default, temporary folders are no longer emptied when Tartube shuts down,
    but only when Tartube starts up. This means you can continue watching
    temporary videos you've downloaded even after shutting down Tartube. If you
    want temporary folders to be emptied on shutdown, as before, select Edit >
    System preferences... > Videos > Empty temporary folders when Tartube shuts
    down

MAJOR FIXES
- Tartube experienced a whole range of problems when downloading videos to a
    hard drive that was running out of space. Tartube now checks the available
    disk space before starting to download anything, and continues checking it
    throughout the download process. You can specify how much disk space should
    be available in the System Preferences window. If the hard drive, despite
    your best efforts, actually does run out of space, Tartube is now much more
    resilient (and can usually halt the download process, rather than
    crashing). The amount of disk space available is now visible in the System
    Preferences window
- Adding a channel/playlist/folder whose name included a slash, for example
    'Adam/Eve's Channel', had unfortunate consequences, with Tartube creating
    a directory (folder) at the wrong location. Slashes are now automatically
    converted to hyphens, which solves the problem
- In Tartube's window, dragging a channel/playlist/folder to a new location in
    the tree changes the hard drive, moving a directory (folder) to a new
    location in the filesystem. If a directory (folder) with the same name
    already existed at that location, an invisible error occurs. Tartube now
    displays a visible error so the user can delete the duplicate directory
    (folder) manually
- When refreshing the Tartube database (e.g. Operations > Refresh database),
    the moviepy module freezes if it encounters a corrupted video file. We
    can't fix the moviepy module, but the Tartube code has been made much more
    resilient
- When refreshing the Tartube database, Tartube made bad decisions if it was
    looking for a video called 'ymca.mp4', but found a video called
    'ymca.webm'. This has been fixed
- Tartube is now able to detect if its data directory (into which videos are
    downloaded) doesn't exist. Usually this is because an external hard drive
    has not been mounted; the user is now warned about this, so they can mount
    it
- On MS Windows, if the user has updated youtube-dl or installed FFmpeg,
    Tartube no longer freezes on shutdown
- On MS Windows, Tartube was unable to open a video file in the system's
    default media player, if the name contained an ampersand. Fixed

MINOR FIXES
- When deleting large channels/playlists/folders, sometimes not everything was
    deleted, and the user had to delete the item a second time. This was due to
    inconsistencies in the Tartube database, which have now been fixed
- Channels/playlists/folders beginning with a number, e.g. '5 Pewdiepie', were
    supposed to be displayed in numerical order, rather than in strict
    alphabetical order. This did not work as intended (e.g. '11 Pewdiepie' was
    listed before '1 T-Series'). Fixed again
- In the 'Delete channel' dialogue window (and so on), the name of the channel
    to be deleted is now displayed prominently
- The size of the MS Windows installer has been reduced by about 40%

v1.2.008 (30 Sep 2019)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

MINOR NEW FEATURES
- Tartube now ignores the YouTube 'WARNING: video doesn't have subtitles'
    by default. You can change this setting, if you want to

MAJOR FIXES
- When moving a channel/playlist/folder to a different place on your
    filesystem, or when renaming a channel/playlist/folder, in certain rare
    situations data in the Tartube database isn't updated correctly. This may
    lead to a freeze or a crash. I'm not sure yet what the cause is, but I have
    added temporary code to prevent the problem affecting any user
- Fixed error messages generated when checking/downloading individual
    channels/playlists/folders
- Fixed faulty code for importing videos/channels/playlists/folders into the
    database

v1.2.0 (31 Aug 2019)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

MAJOR NEW FEATURES
- Multiple channels, playlists and/or folders can now download their videos to
    a single location. The README.rst file explains how it works, and why you
    might want to do it
- You can also tell Tartube to download all videos into the 'Unsorted Videos'
    or 'Temporary Videos' folders, instead of downloading them into separate
    directories/folders for each channel and playlist
- Added automatic deletion of videos, disabled by default. Before enabling it,
    you should do a 'Check all' or 'Download all' operation, which will create
    the necessary youtube-dl archive files
- Added archiving. A video, channel, playlist or folder that is marked
    archived won't be auto-deleted (but can still be deleted manually by the
    user)
- You can now disable both checking and downloading a channel, playlist or
    folder, if you want to. (It was already possible to just disabled
    downloading them)
- Download operations can now be scheduled to take place at regular intervals
- You can now 'Download and watch' a video. The video is opened in your
    system's default media player as soon as it has been downloaded
- Tartube can now download a video's annotations file automatically. Warnings
    generated by YouTube about the lack of annotations are ignored by default
- For channels/playlists/folders containing many videos, you can now skip to
    the first video uploaded after a certain date, using the new button in the
    toolbar at the bottom of the Videos Tab
- The lists in the Results Tab can now be right-clicked, so you can change the
    order in which videos/channels/playlists/folders are checked/downloaded,
    abandon a download, play a video directly from the Results List, delete a
    video directly from the Results List, and so on
- The edit window for youtube-dl options has been improved, adding many new
    options to the GUI interface
- Plain text exports of Tartube's database can now be re-imported. Some
    inconsistencies with the import process (from JSON and plain text files)
    have been fixed

MINOR NEW FEATURES
- Added tooltips in several places. If you don't want to see tooltips above
    videos/channels/playlists/folders, you can turn them off
- You can now select multiple videos in the Video Catalogue, and apply an
    action to all of them (by right-clicking them)
- You can now switch to smaller icons in the Video Index (on the left side of
    the Videos Tab), if you want to
- You can now force the Video Index to expand its tree whenever you click on a
    folder, revealing any channels/playlists it contains. This is disabled by
    default
- If you only want to check videos, and never download them, you can disable
    the 'Download all' buttons. Individual videos/channels/playlists/folders
    can still be downloaded by right-clicking them
- Tartube's file structure has changed. If you run it from the command line,
    you might need to use a (slightly) different command. See the README.rst
    for details of what command to use
- The path to the FFmpeg/AVConv executable can now be specified by the user.
    This will be especially helpful for MS Windows users
- Columns in the Progress Tab can now be manually resized
- The Tartube website can now be opened from the main window menu
- XDG has been added as an optional dependency, for the benefit of Debian
    packagers

MAJOR FIXES
- The MS Windows installer should now work for everyone
- Refresh operations are now stable (should not crash) on systems with Gtk 3.22
    or earlier
- When downloads were disabled for a folder, downloads for channels/playlists/
    folders inside that folder were still enabled. This is counter-intuitive,
    so disabling downloads for a folder disables downloads for everything it
    contains
- Marking/unmarking a video as favourite caused certain problems, which should
    now be fixed

MINOR FIXES
- Fixed some unicode errors in reading JSON and plain text files
- Fixed the wrong page size displayed in the toolbar at the bototm of the
    Videos Tab
- Empty lines in a video's description are now preserved when they're displayed
    in Tartube's main window

v1.1.0 (18 Aug 2019)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

MAJOR NEW FEATURES
- You can now create an export of Tartube's database. This export contains
    details of videos, channels, playlists and/or folders, but not the videos
    themselves (or any of the thumbnail/description/metadata files). The
    export can take two forms: JSON data, or plain text. If JSON data, the
    exported file can later be imported into another Tartube database (imports
    from plain text are not implemented yet). You can export either the
    entire database, or just one channel/playlist/folder (and everythng it
    contains)
- You can now change the name of a channel, playlist of folder. This doesn't
    have any effect on your filesystem; it only changes the name displayed in
    the Video Index (the left-hand side of the Videos Tab). This might be
    useful for channels and playlists that have weird or very short names. For
    example, right-click a folder and select 'Folder actions > Set nickname...'
- You can also rename the channel, playlist or folder, and this action DOES
    affect the filesystem, changing the directory/folder on your hard drive
    where the channel/playlist/folder videos are stored. For example, right-
    click a folder and select 'Filesystem > Rename location...'
- If you change the format of a downloaded video file from the default 'Title'
    to, for example, 'Title + ID', the Video catalogue (the right-hand side of
    the Videos Tab) will now simply display the video's title (which should be
    easier to read). To see the actual filename, you can right-click the video
    and select 'Show properties'. This only works if the video's metadata was
    downloaded when the video itself was downloaded; this is now turned on by
    default for all new users

MINOR NEW FEATURES
- When adding videos, channels and playlists, the contents of the system's
    clipboard was automatically copied into the window. This can now be turned
    off, if you wish (Edit > System preferences... > Windows > When adding
    videos/channels/playlists, copy URLs from the system clipboard)
- When adding channels/playlists, you can set the dialogue window to stay open,
    which makes adding multiple channels/playlists quicker (Edit >
    System preferences... > Windows > When adding channels/playlists, keep the
    dialogue window open)
- When creating channels/playlists/folders inside an existing parent folder, a
    dialogue window which stays open can be told to continuously re-use that
    parent folder (Edit > System preferences... > Windows > When adding
    channels/playlists, re-use the optional parent folder)
- When checking/downloading videos, the Results List (the bottom half of the
    Progress Tab) can now display videos in reverse order, so you don't have to
    scroll down to see the video that was just checked/downloaded (Edit >
    System Preferences... > Windows > Show results in reverse order)
- The number of ystem error and warning messages displayed in their own tab
    is visible in the tab's label. The label is usually reset when the tab
    is made visible. You can now disable this behaviour, preserving the numbers
    until the 'Clear the list' button is explicitly clicked (Edit >
    System preferences... > Windows > Don't remove number of system messages
    from tab label until 'Clear' button is clicked)
- Items in the Video Index (on the left-hand side of the Videos Tab) are sorted
    alphabetically. The sorting algorithm has been improved to take account of
    numbered items, such that '1 Music' will now appear before '11 Comedy'
- For the benefit of package maintainers (such as a Debian package), Tartube
    now uses an environment variable which will prevent Tartube from updating
    the youtube-dl binary, if specified. See the comments in setup.py

MAJOR FIXES
- Users whose system Gtk is earlier than v3.24 (this includes many current
    Linux distros, but the MS Windows installer) will have experienced graphics
    issues, and endless error messages in the terminal window, if open. If your
    system Gtk is earlier than v3.24, Tartube will no longer update the Video
    Index during a download operation; this should fix the issue at the cost of
    disabling real-time updates of the number of videos in each channel,
    playlist and folder. Your system's Gtk version is now visible in Tartube's
    System Preferences window
- After loading the config file, the download limits were set, but not
    displayed in the Progress Tab. Fixed
- Rarely, Tartube crashes (or freezes) when loading a video's JSON metadata
    file from your filesystem (but now when downloading it). This should no
    longer happen

MINOR FIXES
- The 'Channel properties', 'Folder properties' (etc) windows used the wrong
    icon (displaying a folder in the wrong colour). Fixed
- Fixed a 'list modified during sort' error during a download operation

v1.0.0 (31 Jul 2019)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- First beta release
- Fixed some issues with the MS Windows installer
- Some parts of the Tartube window displayed the wrong icons. Fixed

v0.7.0 (7 Jul 2019)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- This is the first release candidate for v1.0.0
- The MS Windows installer has been redesigned again (thanks to slartie for his
    generous assistance in getting it working). Some MS Windows 10 users were
    still complaining that Tartube would not run; this should be fixed now
- MS Windows should find that the annoying terminal window is no longer visible
- Deleting individual videos, then adding them to the Tartube database again,
    could cause problems with the statistics displayed in the Video Index (e.g.
    'All Videos (0, -1)'. Fixed
- Deleting and individual video by right-clicking it removed the video from the
    database, but didn't delete the video file itself. Fixed
- If an empty channel/playlist was selected, new videos did not automatically
    appear in the Video Catalogue during a download operation. Fixed
- Fixed some issues with the Temporary Videos folder
- Fixed more issues with videos being dislayed in the wrong order in the Video
    Catalogue
- Fixed more issues with the scrollbars not resetting themselves when switching
    between channels/playlists/folders
- After right-clicking a folder, selecting Mark Videos > New didn't work. Fixed
- When marking videos as new/favourite, you can now do this to all videos
    in a folder, including all child channels/playlists/folders, or you can do
    it just to the videos actually inside that folder. There are several new
    popup menu options for emptying a folder, or for removing all its videos
- Tartube will no longer issue a system error if you drag a folder onto itself
    in the Video Index
- Fixed the remaining issues caused by the Gtk graphics libraries
- Confirmed that various Gtk issues present in Gtk3.22 are not present in
    Gtk 3.24. Users with Gtk 3.22 on their system will be warned to update it.
    These warnings can be disabled, if required

v0.6.0 (4 Jul 2019)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Some MS Windows users, especially on Windows 10, report that they can't run
    Tartube at all. In an effort to get around this, the installer has been
    redesigned. The way Tartube communicates with youtube-dl on MS Windows has
    been changed. youtube-dl update operations should now work flawlessly.
    Please report any further problems at our GitHub page; this might be a fix
    to issue #10
- Users on Linux/*BSD can now run Tartube directly from the command line, after
    installing it (see the README)
- Occasionally, videos were downloaded (or checked) successfully, but Tartube
    failed to notice them. This issue should now be fixed
- When checking videos/channels/playlists/folders, only new videos will now
    appear in the Results List (in the 'Progress' Tab)
- The toolbar has been redesigned. MS Windows users won't see labels at all
    (so everything should fit). Users on all system can turn labels on or off.
    Tooltips have been added to the buttons, in case the labels are turned off
- Fixed yet another problem with button to switch the location of Tartube's
    data folder (#6)
- Tartube no longer requires the python 'validators' module
- Tartube can now ignore YouTube copyright messages, and also 'Child process
    exited with non-zero code' messages, meaning that they won't appear in
    Tartube's Errors/Warnings Tab. (They are not ignored by default)
- Tartube now applies a 60-second timeout when youtube-dl tries to download
    a video's metadata (since youtube-dl uses a 10-minute timeout); this can be
    turned off, if required (#9)
- Fixed some more issues with the way videos are sorted in the Video Catalogue
    (it's still not 100%)
- Users can no longer type in comboboxes
- Tartube now spots when the user adds a channel or playlist URL as a video;
    only the first video in the channel/playlist is now downloaded
- You can no longer remove download options from a media data object when the
    download options edit window is still open
- When you update youtube-dl, Tartube will now tell you which youtube-dl
    version is installed. Tartube will no longer claim the update operation
    fails if you're using pip (rather than pip3)

v0.5.0 (1 Jul 2019)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- On MS Windows, the fix from v0.4.0 to prevent a crash whenever the user tries
    to change the location of Tartube's data directory, did not work. Fixed it
    again (#6), and added some dialogue window to make it clearer to the user
    what is going on
- Fixed problems with dragging-and-dropping (or otherwise moving) a channel,
    playlist or folder to a new location (such as another folder). The videos
    were not updated with their new location. The new code will fix any
    problems in the Tartube database
- Fixed numerous problems with the code that sorts videos into the right order,
    and which displays videos in the Video Catalogue in the right order
- The 'Switch' button no longer resets the page back to the first one
- When switching between channels/playlists/folders, scrollbars are
    automatically moved back to the top
- In the toolbar beneath the Video Catalogue, there are two new buttons for
    scrolling to the top or bottom of the visible page. Users can now select
    a different page just by typing the page number and pressing RETURN. The
    same applies to the page size - there is no button to click any more, just
    type the new size and press RETURN
- Fixed several problems which were still preventing selection of different
    video formats (#3)
- Added bare-bones aac, m4a, mp3, ogg and wav as recognised video formats
- A set of download options can now be completely reset to their default values
- The 'Add Videos' dialogue window, and some others, don't behave well when the
    user resizes them. Fixed (#4)
- Added a small folder icon to the the 'Add Videos' dialogue window, and
    others, so the user is less likely to forget to set a custom location
- In the 'Add Videos' dialogue window, and others, URLs are now tidied up a
    bit because being copied from the clipboard, eliminating leading/trailing
    whitespace and empty lines
- The Gtk test window, available for MS Windows after using the installer,
    now contains some text (to make it clear that the window is working as
    intended)

v0.4.0 (29 Jun 2019)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Drastic improvements to overall performance. Download operations are now much
    smoother. You should notice a much lighter burden on your machine's CPU
- The graphics libraries struggled to draw lists containing hundreds (or
    thousands!) of videos, so the Video Catalogue has been split into pages. It
    typically takes less then a second to show the 'All Videos' folder, if it
    contains hundreds of videos, rather than several minutes
- If you just want to find new videos, you can now tell Tartube to stop
    checking/downloading channels/playlists as soon as notifications of videos
    you've already checked/downloaded start arriving. This works well on
    YouTube, which sends the newest videos first, but might not work well on
    all websites. The new functionality is turned off by default. Click
    'Edit > System preferences > Performance > Time-saving preferences' to turn
    it on
- The installer for 32-bit MS Windows failed under all circumstances. Applied a
    fix
- On MS Windows, the uninstaller was invisible. It can now be executed from the
    Start Menu
- On MS Windows, fixed a crash whenever the user tried to changed the location
    of Tartube's data directory (#6)
- Fixed some problems with the 'Add videos' dialogue window, which tried to add
    all sorts of invalid URLs (such as lines containing only empty space). The
    other 'Add' dialogue windows were also fixed
- A limit to the length of a channel/playlist/folder name now applies
- Leading/trailing whitespace is now removed from URLs and channel/playlist/
    folder names
- The 'Add videos' dialogue window now checks for duplicate URLs, and when
    found, doesn't add them to the database
- Fixed various problems caused by deleting a video/channel/playlist/folder
    (such as the numbers visible in the Video Index). If you've been using an
    earlier version of Tartube, any such problems with the database will be
    automatically repaired for you (#8)
- Videos which haven't actually been downloaded can now be deleted from the
    database by right-clicking them
- Added new options for making backups of the Tartube database file, in case it
    becomes corrupted. See the settings in
    'Edit > System preferences... > Backups'
- The 'Switch' button now switches between four 'skins' (instead of the
    previous two). Two of them show the name of a video's parent channel/
    playlist/folder; the other two show the video's description
- Fixed incorrect formatting in the DASH and 3D file formats (#3)

v0.3.0 (25 Jun 2019)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Tartube will now run on MS Windows
- Fixed some more crashes
- Fixed some issues with video descriptions containing quotes and ampersand
    characters

v0.2.0 (23 Jun 2019)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Corrected old Python2 code to work on Python3
- Greatly expanded the README file
- Fixed the constant crashes
- Fixed some Gtk problems (but others remain unfixed)
- Fixed downloads for users who haven't installed Ffmpeg, and for sites that
    don't support Ffmpeg
- Several other minor tweaks/fixes

v0.1.0 (27 May 2019)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- This is the first public release of Tartube
