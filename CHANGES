v1.1.0 (18 Aug 2019)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

MAJOR NEW FEATURES
- You can now create an export of Tartube's database. This export contains
    details of videos, channels, playlists and/or folders, but not the videos
    themselves (or any of the thumbnail/description/metadata files). The
    export can take two forms: JSON data, or plain text. If JSON data, the
    exported file can later be imported into another Tartube database (imports
    from plain text are not implemented yet). You can export either the
    entire database, or just one channel/playlist/folder (and everythng it
    contains)
- You can now change the name of a channel, playlist of folder. This doesn't
    have any effect on your filesystem; it only changes the name displayed in
    the Video Index (the left-hand side of the Videos tab). This might be
    useful for channels and playlists that have weird or very short names. For
    example, right-click a folder and select 'Folder actions > Set nickname...'
- You can also rename the channel, playlist or folder, and this action DOES
    affect the filesystem, changing the directory/folder on your hard drive
    where the channel/playlist/folder videos are stored. For example, right-
    click a folder and select 'Filesystem > Rename location...'
- If you change the format of a downloaded video file from the default 'Title'
    to, for example, 'Title + ID', the Video catalogue (the right-hand side of
    the Videos tab) will now simply display the video's title (which should be
    easier to read). To see the actual filename, you can right-click the video
    and select 'Show properties'. This only works if the video's metadata was
    downloaded when the video itself was downloaded; this is now turned on by
    default for all new users

MINOR NEW FEATURES
- When adding videos, channels and playlists, the contents of the system's
    clipboard was automatically copied into the window. This can now be turned
    off, if you wish (Edit > System preferences... > Windows > When adding
    videos/channels/playlists, copy URLs from the system clipboard)
- When adding channels/playlists, you can set the dialogue window to stay open,
    which makes adding multiple channels/playlists quicker (Edit >
    System preferences... > Windows > When adding channels/playlists, keep the
    dialogue window open)
- When creating channels/playlists/folders inside an existing parent folder, a
    dialogue window which stays open can be told to continuously re-use that
    parent folder (Edit > System preferences... > Windows > When adding
    channels/playlists, re-use the optional parent folder)
- When checking/downloading videos, the Results List (the bottom half of the
    Progress tab) can now display videos in reverse order, so you don't have to
    scroll down to see the video that was just checked/downloaded (Edit >
    System Preferences... > Windows > Show results in reverse order)
- The number of ystem error and warning messages displayed in their own tab
    is visible in the tab's label. The label is usually reset when the tab
    is made visible. You can now disable this behaviour, preserving the numbers
    until the 'Clear the list' button is explicitly clicked (Edit >
    System preferences... > Windows > Don't remove number of system messages
    from tab lable until 'Clear' button is clicked)
- Items in the Video Index (on the left-hand side of the Videos tab) are sorted
    alphabetically. The sorting algorithm has been improved to take account of
    numbered items, such that '1 Music' will now appear before '11 Comedy'
- For the benefit of package maintainers (such as a Debian package), Tartube
    now uses an environment variable which will prevent Tartube from updating
    the youtube-dl binary, if specified. See the comments in setup.py

MAJOR FIXES
- Users whose system Gtk is earlier than v3.24 (this includes many current
    Linux distros, but the MS Windows installer) will have experienced graphics
    issues, and endless error messages in the terminal window, if open. If your
    system Gtk is earlier than v3.24, Tartube will no longer update the Video
    Index during a download operation; this should fix the issue at the cost of
    disabling real-time updates of the number of videos in each channel,
    playlist and folder. Your system's Gtk version is now visible in Tartube's
    System Preferences window
- After loading the config file, the download limits were set, but not
    displayed in the Progress tab. Fixed
- Rarely, Tartube crashes (or freezes) when loading a video's JSON metadata
    file from your filesystem (but now when downloading it). This should no
    longer happen

MINOR FIXES
- The 'Channel properties', 'Folder properties' (etc) windows used the wrong
    icon (displaying a folder in the wrong colour). Fixed
- Fixed a 'list modified during sort' error during a download operation

v1.0.0 (31 Jul 2019)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- First beta release
- Fixed some issues with the MS Windows installer
- Some parts of the Tartube window displayed the wrong icons. Fixed

v0.7.0 (7 Jul 2019)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- This is the first release candidate for v1.0.0
- The MS Windows installer has been redesigned again (thanks to slartie for his
    generous assistance in getting it working). Some MS Windows 10 users were
    still complaining that Tartube would not run; this should be fixed now
- MS Windows should find that the annoying terminal window is no longer visible
- Deleting individual videos, then adding them to the Tartube database again,
    could cause problems with the statistics displayed in the Video Index (e.g.
    'All Videos (0, -1)'. Fixed
- Deleting and individual video by right-clicking it removed the video from the
    database, but didn't delete the video file itself. Fixed
- If an empty channel/playlist was selected, new videos did not automatically
    appear in the Video Catalogue during a download operation. Fixed
- Fixed some issues with the Temporary Videos folder
- Fixed more issues with videos being dislayed in the wrong order in the Video
    Catalogue
- Fixed more issues with the scrollbars not resetting themselves when switching
    between channels/playlists/folders
- After right-clicking a folder, selecting Mark Videos > New didn't work. Fixed
- When marking videos as new/favourite, you can now do this to all videos
    in a folder, including all child channels/playlists/folders, or you can do
    it just to the videos actually inside that folder. There are several new
    popup menu options for emptying a folder, or for removing all its videos
- Tartube will no longer issue a system error if you drag a folder onto itself
    in the Video Index
- Fixed the remaining issues caused by the Gtk graphics libraries
- Confirmed that various Gtk issues present in Gtk3.22 are not present in
    Gtk 3.24. Users with Gtk 3.22 on their system will be warned to update it.
    These warnings can be disabled, if required

v0.6.0 (4 Jul 2019)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Some MS Windows users, especially on Windows 10, report that they can't run
    Tartube at all. In an effort to get around this, the installer has been
    redesigned. The way Tartube communicates with youtube-dl on MS Windows has
    been changed. youtube-dl update operations should now work flawlessly.
    Please report any further problems at our GitHub page; this might be a fix
    to issue #10
- Users on Linux/*BSD can now run Tartube directly from the command line, after
    installing it (see the README)
- Occasionally, videos were downloaded (or checked) successfully, but Tartube
    failed to notice them. This issue should now be fixed
- When checking videos/channels/playlists/folders, only new videos will now
    appear in the Results List (in the 'Progress' tab)
- The toolbar has been redesigned. MS Windows users won't see labels at all
    (so everything should fit). Users on all system can turn labels on or off.
    Tooltips have been added to the buttons, in case the labels are turned off
- Fixed yet another problem with button to switch the location of Tartube's
    data folder (#6)
- Tartube no longer requires the python 'validators' module
- Tartube can now ignore YouTube copyright messages, and also 'Child process
    exited with non-zero code' messages, meaning that they won't appear in
    Tartube's 'Errors/Warnings' tab. (They are not ignored by default)
- Tartube now applies a 60-second timeout when youtube-dl tries to download
    a video's metadata (since youtube-dl uses a 10-minute timeout); this can be
    turned off, if required (#9)
- Fixed some more issues with the way videos are sorted in the Video Catalogue
    (it's still not 100%)
- Users can no longer type in comboboxes
- Tartube now spots when the user adds a channel or playlist URL as a video;
    only the first video in the channel/playlist is now downloaded
- You can no longer remove download options from a media data object when the
    download options edit window is still open
- When you update youtube-dl, Tartube will now tell you which youtube-dl
    version is installed. Tartube will no longer claim the update operation
    fails if you're using pip (rather than pip3)

v0.5.0 (1 Jul 2019)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- On MS Windows, the fix from v0.4.0 to prevent a crash whenever the user tries
    to change the location of Tartube's data directory, did not work. Fixed it
    again (#6), and added some dialogue window to make it clearer to the user
    what is going on
- Fixed problems with dragging-and-dropping (or otherwise moving) a channel,
    playlist or folder to a new location (such as another folder). The videos
    were not updated with their new location. The new code will fix any
    problems in the Tartube database
- Fixed numerous problems with the code that sorts videos into the right order,
    and which displays videos in the Video Catalogue in the right order
- The 'Switch' button no longer resets the page back to the first one
- When switching between channels/playlists/folders, scrollbars are
    automatically moved back to the top
- In the toolbar beneath the Video Catalogue, there are two new buttons for
    scrolling to the top or bottom of the visible page. Users can now select
    a different page just by typing the page number and pressing RETURN. The
    same applies to the page size - there is no button to click any more, just
    type the new size and press RETURN
- Fixed several problems which were still preventing selection of different
    video formats (#3)
- Added bare-bones aac, m4a, mp3, ogg and wav as recognised video formats
- A set of download options can now be completely reset to their default values
- The 'Add Videos' dialogue window, and some others, don't behave well when the
    user resizes them. Fixed (#4)
- Added a small folder icon to the the 'Add Videos' dialogue window, and
    others, so the user is less likely to forget to set a custom location
- In the 'Add Videos' dialogue window, and others, URLs are now tidied up a
    bit because being copied from the clipboard, eliminating leading/trailing
    whitespace and empty lines
- The Gtk test window, available for MS Windows after using the installer,
    now contains some text (to make it clear that the window is working as
    intended)

v0.4.0 (29 Jun 2019)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Drastic improvements to overall performance. Download operations are now much
    smoother. You should notice a much lighter burden on your machine's CPU
- The graphics libraries struggled to draw lists containing hundreds (or
    thousands!) of videos, so the Video Catalogue has been split into pages. It
    typically takes less then a second to show the 'All Videos' folder, if it
    contains hundreds of videos, rather than several minutes
- If you just want to find new videos, you can now tell Tartube to stop
    checking/downloading channels/playlists as soon as notifications of videos
    you've already checked/downloaded start arriving. This works well on
    YouTube, which sends the newest videos first, but might not work well on
    all websites. The new functionality is turned off by default. Click
    'Edit > System preferences > Performance > Time-saving preferences' to turn
    it on
- The installer for 32-bit MS Windows failed under all circumstances. Applied a
    fix
- On MS Windows, the uninstaller was invisible. It can now be executed from the
    Start Menu
- On MS Windows, fixed a crash whenever the user tried to changed the location
    of Tartube's data directory (#6)
- Fixed some problems with the 'Add videos' dialogue window, which tried to add
    all sorts of invalid URLs (such as lines containing only empty space). The
    other 'Add' dialogue windows were also fixed
- A limit to the length of a channel/playlist/folder name now applies
- Leading/trailing whitespace is now removed from URLs and channel/playlist/
    folder names
- The 'Add videos' dialogue window now checks for duplicate URLs, and when
    found, doesn't add them to the database
- Fixed various problems caused by deleting a video/channel/playlist/folder
    (such as the numbers visible in the Video Index). If you've been using an
    earlier version of Tartube, any such problems with the database will be
    automatically repaired for you (#8)
- Videos which haven't actually been downloaded can now be deleted from the
    database by right-clicking them
- Added new options for making backups of the Tartube database file, in case it
    becomes corrupted. See the settings in
    'Edit > System preferences... > Backups'
- The 'Switch' button now switches between four 'skins' (instead of the
    previous two). Two of them show the name of a video's parent channel/
    playlist/folder; the other two show the video's description
- Fixed incorrect formatting in the DASH and 3D file formats (#3)

v0.3.0 (25 Jun 2019)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Tartube will now run on MS Windows
- Fixed some more crashes
- Fixed some issues with video descriptions containing quotes and ampersand
    characters

v0.2.0 (23 Jun 2019)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Corrected old Python2 code to work on Python3
- Greatly expanded the README file
- Fixed the constant crashes
- Fixed some Gtk problems (but others remain unfixed)
- Fixed downloads for users who haven't installed Ffmpeg, and for sites that
    don't support Ffmpeg
- Several other minor tweaks/fixes

v0.1.0 (27 May 2019)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- This is the first public release of Tartube
