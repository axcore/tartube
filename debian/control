Description: GUI front-end for youtube-dl
 Tartube is a GUI front-end for youtube-dl.
 .
   - You can download individual videos, and even whole channels and playlists,
     from YouTube and hundreds of other sites (see here for a full list)
   - You can fetch information about those videos, channels and playlists,
     without actually downloading anything
   - Tartube will organise your videos into convenient folders
   - Certain popular websites manipulate search results, repeatedly unsubscribe
     people from their favourite channels and/or deliberately conceal videos
     that they don't like. Tartube won't do any of those things
   - Tartube can, in some circumstances, see videos that are region-blocked
     and/or age-restricted
